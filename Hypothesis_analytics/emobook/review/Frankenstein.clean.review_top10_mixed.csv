This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result. ""My cousin,"" replied I, ""it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed."""

Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder."" Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin."

When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.
